## Building

Created using Z88DK on a Linux system. If you use anything else you might need to alter things. The Makefile also contains extra parts from my own build system, you can ignore those at your leisure.

Rename the appropriate "main" file to end in .c (don't do both together!).

If you have a correctly installed z88dk then typing `make install` should compile everything and give you a .nex file inside the (newly created) "dist" folder to copy to your Next. You will also need the converted image that is in the assets folder.

## Licencing

Do what you want with this, it's only API calls glued together in standard ways really.
